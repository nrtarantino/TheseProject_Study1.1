## Running the task locally

1. Install Python 3 if you do not already have it available on your machine.
2. From the repository root, start a simple static web server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) to launch the experiment interface.
4. When you are finished, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the local server.

The task expects the `stimuli/` directory to remain alongside `index.html`, so keep the default folder structure intact when running locally.
